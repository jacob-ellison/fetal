Estimate of Fetal Brain Temperature Using PRF Thermometry during Fetal MRI

This repository contains the code and data used for analysis used in the paper.

Fetal_temp_analysis_submission.ipynb is a jupyter notebook for the analysis on relative fetal temperature.
GA_differences.ipynb is a jupyter notebook for analysis on differences in Gestational Age between groups.

ROIs and phase metrics are stored in records_temp/ (Fetal_temps_v2.csv containes corrected image numbers and durations).
MATLAB processing code starts with /fetal/temp/get_temp_comdiv.m.
